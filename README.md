## Reflection

This was a long project in an attempt to get familiar with the React codebase in actual production.

I coded along with the [tutorial](https://youtu.be/x_EEwGe-a9o) of Karl Hadwen. I modified each section a little bit, added subtle text animations and added popup boxes for photos in the profile page. I also did full coverage on testing and all of those are in a private repo. 

This repo only includes the version without personal modifcation and testing. If you want to see how the testing is done, consider supporting Karl Hadwen himself by buying the paid video which includes the testing process.

At the end of the day, this project uses React, React-Router, TailwindCSS, Firebase, React testing library and Cypress testing.
